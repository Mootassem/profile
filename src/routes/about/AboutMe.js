      <p className='white-text p-tag'>
        As a front-end developer with 2 years of experience, I have a strong
        foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am well-versed in
        preprocessors such as SASS and SCSS and have experience building
        responsive, mobile-friendly websites. I have also worked with popular
        JavaScript libraries and frameworks, including ReactJS and TypeScript.
        In addition to front-end development, I am also familiar with Node.js
        and MongoDB for full-stack development. My portfolio showcases the
        projects and skills that I have developed during my career, and
        demonstrates my ability to create visually appealing and user-friendly
        web applications.
